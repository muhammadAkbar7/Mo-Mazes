# CSE 373 Projects

Most proud project:

Maze Carver and Solver (Java) 			         	           
Developed a Kruskal maze carver with the following features: generates visually random-looking mazes, ensures maze solvability, and minimizes wall removal for maze creation
Implemented a self-built disjoint data sets structure to increase efficiency in maze generation by 22% and employed Dijkstra's algorithm to compute and return the shortest path within the Kruskal-generated maze

You'll use this Git repository for all coding project assignments in this class.

This project is meant to be imported into IntelliJ as a Gradle project.

You are not expected to understand the contents of any Gradle-related files,
and may safely ignore them---if you encounter issues with project setup, please
seek help from the course staff.

See [the projects page on the course website](https://cs.uw.edu/373/projects/)
for more instructions.

(In theory, it should be possible to complete our projects using the Gradle
support in any other IDE or by using Gradle without an IDE, but the course
staff may not be able to provide technical support if you do so.)
